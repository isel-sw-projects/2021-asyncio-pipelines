This thesis examines the evolution of data collection methodologies, transitioning from traditional asynchronous I/O systems to modern reactive programming paradigms such as Reactive Programming and Kotlin Flow. These paradigms represent a shift from static, sequential processes to dynamic, responsive data handling strategies, a transformation driven by recent advances in programming techniques.

After presenting a concise historical overview to contextualize the study, the research focuses on a comparative analysis of key technologies like RxJava and .NET AsyncEnumerables, which utilize reactive streams to enhance the efficiency and scalability of large data volume management. The benchmarking methodology is straightforward yet effective, concentrating on how these technologies perform fundamental tasks—such as identifying the largest word in a dataset and categorizing words by letter count—especially when scaled to large datasets typical of real-world scenarios.

This pragmatic approach allows for a direct evaluation of each technology's real-time data processing capabilities, underlining practical benefits and distinguishing their performances. In conclusion, the thesis provides a focused comparative analysis to enhance understanding of data collection technologies, clarifying key concepts and demonstrating the advancements from traditional to modern tools. It also offers a practical comparison based on performance, enabling readers to appreciate the functionality and efficiency of these technologies and make informed choices.
