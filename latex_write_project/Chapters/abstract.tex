This thesis embarks on an investigative journey into the evolution of data collection methodologies, with a spotlight on the transition from traditional mechanisms to the cutting-edge paradigm of Reactive Programming. It scrutinizes how the advent of software paradigms has revolutionized data collection practices, transitioning from verbose and sequential methods to dynamic and responsive strategies facilitated by modern programming approaches.

Central to this research is a comparative analysis that delves into the intricacies of programming paradigms like Reactive Programming, Async/Await patterns, and Async Enumerables. The study meticulously evaluates technologies such as RxJava and .NET AsyncEnumerables, dissecting their semantics, solutions, and strategic implementations. By conducting empirical research through own made software implementations tailored for intensive I/O operations, this thesis uncovers the distinct advantages and challenges posed by each technology in handling and processing data from extensive sources in real-time scenarios.

The comparative study is designed to highlight the efficacy, scalability, and responsiveness of these programming paradigms, providing a detailed examination of their performance in real-world applications. It aims to distill the critical factors that influence the selection of one technology over another, considering the specific demands of data-intensive environments.

Conclusively, this thesis presents a nuanced evaluation of the findings, articulating the strengths and limitations of each examined technology. It synthesizes the insights gained from the comparative analysis to offer conclutions that can be made when chosing between one or another approach. Furthermore, the thesis outlines prospective avenues for future research, suggesting pathways for the advancement of data collection and processing technologies.
