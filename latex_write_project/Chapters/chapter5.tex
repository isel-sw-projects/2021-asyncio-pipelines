\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}

\section{Main Conclusions}

The analysis of reactive streams programming and pipelining technologies throughout this thesis highlights their substantial benefits in terms of user-friendliness and maintenance simplicity. Nonetheless, these technologies also present certain drawbacks which must be carefully considered in the context of specific application requirements and desired outcomes.

For systems demanding high performance and robustness, a baseline-like approach, which allows for custom optimization, might be ideal. Conversely, for rapid development with satisfactory performance and easier maintenance, tools like RxJava and .NET's AsyncEnumerable provide valuable solutions. The choice largely depends on the project's long-term objectives and operational context. For example, high-frequency trading systems require the raw speed and low latency that finely tuned baseline systems provide. In scenarios where time-to-market is crucial, the productivity benefits of higher-level frameworks may outweigh their performance costs.

Another significant finding is the scalability offered by reactive programming technologies, which is essential for applications expected to handle growing data volumes or increased throughput over time.

While baseline approaches generally performed better in specific algorithms, the practicality of using advanced frameworks like RxJava or .NET's AsyncEnumerable in enterprise environments cannot be overlooked. They facilitate rapid development and easier maintenance, which are often prioritized over minor performance gains in many professional settings.

Moreover, the selection of the appropriate technology or framework is invariably influenced by the specific demands of the project, underscoring the need for a tailored approach in software development.

\section{Future Work and Final Thoughts}

Looking ahead, there are several promising directions for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exploration of Emerging Frameworks:} Continual investigation into new and emerging frameworks can provide insights into more efficient and scalable solutions for managing asynchronous tasks.
    \item \textbf{Enhancement of Benchmarking Tools:} Developing and utilizing more accurate and comprehensive benchmarking tools to measure the performance, scalability, and reliability of asynchronous technologies across different scenarios will be crucial. This enhancement will allow for deeper insights into both established and emerging technologies and strategies.
    \item \textbf{Integration with AI and Machine Learning:} There is a growing intersection between asynchronous programming and artificial intelligence. Exploring how these technologies can be integrated could open up new possibilities for automated real-time data processing and decision-making systems.
\end{itemize}

In our final thoughts, this work has clearly demonstrated that different approaches significantly impact the effectiveness of solutions. In today's digital environment, dominated by live data streaming, the method of handling data asynchronously is more crucial than ever. It has been shown that adhering to robust programming practices and selecting the appropriate tools and strategies, based on best practices, are critical.
