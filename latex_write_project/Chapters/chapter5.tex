\chapter{Conclusions and Future Directions}

\section{Main Conclusions}
The analysis of reactive streams programming and pipelining technologies throughout this thesis highlights their substantial benefits in terms of user-friendliness and maintenance simplicity. Nonetheless, these technologies also present certain drawbacks which must be carefully considered in the context of specific application requirements and desired outcomes.

For systems demanding high performance and robustness, a baseline-like approach, which allows for custom optimization, might be ideal. Conversely, for rapid development with satisfactory performance and easier maintenance, tools like RxJava and .NET's AsyncEnumerable provide valuable solutions. The choice largely depends on the project's long-term objectives and operational context. For example, high-frequency trading systems require the raw speed and low latency that finely tuned baseline systems provide. In scenarios where time-to-market is crucial, the productivity benefits of higher-level frameworks may outweigh their performance costs.

Another significant finding is the scalability offered by reactive programming technologies, which is essential for applications expected to handle growing data volumes or increased throughput over time.

For each language we took, some conclusions:

\subsection{.NET Environment Analysis}
In the .NET ecosystem, strategies utilizing parallel computing clearly outperformed others, emphasizing the importance of leveraging modern CPU architectures to enhance processing capabilities.

\subsection{Java/Kotlin Environment Insights}
In Java and Kotlin environments, parallelization strategies proved most effective, highlighting the necessity of concurrent processing for handling complex or large data sets efficiently.

\subsection{JavaScript Strategy Performance}
The RxJS library demonstrated its efficacy in JavaScript, particularly for tasks like "Grouping Words," showcasing its capability to manage data streams efficiently—a crucial aspect for web applications.

\subsection{Overarching Conclusions}
While baseline approaches generally performed better in specific algorithms, the practicality of using advanced frameworks like RxJava or .NET's AsyncEnumerable in enterprise environments cannot be overlooked. They facilitate rapid development and easier maintenance, which are often prioritized over minor performance gains in many professional settings.

Moreover, the selection of the appropriate technology or framework is invariably influenced by the specific demands of the project, underscoring the need for a tailored approach in software development.

\section{Future Work and Final Thoughts}

This thesis underscores that asynchronous I/O technologies are not merely technical tools but also catalysts for broader transformations in software engineering. They hold the potential to redefine paradigms of software development and maintenance.

As we advance into an increasingly digital era, the strategic use of these technologies—especially for managing complex data flows in real-time—is already critical. They are poised to enhance system robustness and significantly reduce failure rates, which are crucial considerations that every IT engineer must take into account today.

Future research should focus on discovering new technologies and employing more ambitious benchmark tools to compare these technologies. Additionally, future lines of this work should explore the development of potential solutions that may surpass the performance of existing tools like RxJava, aiming to achieve performance closer to the baseline approaches discussed earlier in this document.
