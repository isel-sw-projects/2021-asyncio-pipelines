I would like to extend special thanks to my advisor, Doctor Miguel de Carvalho, for his persistence and availability. Without this support, I would not have been able to complete this stage. Thank you very much.

I also wish to thank ISEL, the coordinator of the MEIC master's program, and my family, who have always supported me.

To everyone, my deepest thanks.
